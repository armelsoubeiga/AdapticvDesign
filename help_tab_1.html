<i>AppShiny</i> is designed to aid statisticians and clinical investigators in planning randomized trials. It can be used to explore whether certain adaptive designs offer tangible benefits compared to standard designs, in the context of investigators' specific trial goals and constraints. Specifically, AppShiny compares the performance of certain trial designs with adaptive enrollment criteria to that of standard (non-adaptive) group sequential designs. Performance is evaluated in terms of power, expected trial duration, and expected sample size.
